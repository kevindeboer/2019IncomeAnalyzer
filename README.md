# 2019IncomeAnalyzer
Vizualise all bank transactions made for 2019.

Given a csv export of all 2019 transactions from my bank. Parse it, categorize each transaction by matching them to a list of rules, and plot the total for each category for each month in a stacked bar chart.

To protect my private information, the csv export, the matching rules and the final graph have been redacted from the source code.
